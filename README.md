# Dual Publish

Publish JS project as dual ES modules and CommonJS package to npm.

* Works with **Node.js**, **browsers**, and **bundlers** like webpack or Parcel.
* **No build step.** No need for separated `src/` and `dist/` dirs in repository.
  You will be able to test branch by installing version from GitHub like
  `npm i example@you/example#fix`.
* **Multiple files support**. Your user will be able to import separated files
  like `import async from 'nanoid/async'`.
* **Cleans npm package** from development configs [before publishing].

## Limits

* Node.js ESM users should manually add `index.mjs` to import, because
  [Conditional Exports] prints warning even for `require()`.
* Only default export is supported right now, since Node.js doesnâ€™t support
  combining default and named exports for CommonJS.
* Every JS file should be in separated dir. `lib/index.js` instead of `lib.js`.
  We need it to put `package.json` with `module` field for bundlers.

## Usage

1. Take a normal CommonJS project with `require()` and `module.exports =`.
2. Move all files into separated dirs. Like rename `lib.js` to `lib/index.js`.
   Old `require('./lib')` will work.
3. Add `dual-publish` to the project:

   ```sh
   npm i --save-dev dual-publish
   ```
4. Test the result by calling `npx dual-publish --without-publish`.
   It will create a folder in your project with converted files.
   Review them manually.
5. Publish your project with `npx dual-publish` instead of `npm publish`.
